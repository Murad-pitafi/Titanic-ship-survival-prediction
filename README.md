# Titanic-ship-survival-prediction

This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset using data analysis techniques and machine learning models. The goal was to gain insights into the dataset, preprocess the data, and evaluate the performance of various machine learning algorithms. The project helped improve proficiency in data analysis, machine learning, and interpreting results.

## Dataset Cleaning and Preprocessing

The initial step involved cleaning the dataset using Pandas, a powerful data manipulation library in Python. Through this process, missing values, outliers, and irrelevant data were handled to ensure data integrity. By applying appropriate techniques, the dataset was refined, enabling more accurate analysis.

Furthermore, the data was scaled using suitable scaling techniques to normalize the features. This step was crucial for achieving optimal performance during the machine learning model training and evaluation phase.

## Machine Learning Models

Several machine learning models were employed to analyze the Titanic dataset. These models included:

1. Naive Bayes
2. Logistic Regression
3. Decision Tree
4. K Nearest Neighbor
5. Random Forest
6. Support Vector Classifier
7. Xtreme Gradient Boosting
8. Soft Voting Classifier

Training and testing were performed on each model to assess their performance. This comparative analysis provided valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different algorithms for the given dataset.

## Learning Outcomes

Working on the Titanic dataset enhanced proficiency in data analysis and machine learning techniques. Key learning outcomes include:

1. Effective data preprocessing: Acquired skills to clean and preprocess data, handle missing values, and deal with outliers, resulting in improved data quality.
2. Model evaluation and selection: Gained experience in evaluating multiple machine learning models and selecting the most suitable one based on performance metrics.
3. Understanding machine learning algorithms: Developed a deeper understanding of how various algorithms work, their underlying concepts, and the interpretation of their results.

## Conclusion
